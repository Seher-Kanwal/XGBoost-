# XGBoost 
XGBoost is an ensemble learning method that combines several weak learners (often decision trees) to form a strong learner. It is based on the gradient boosting algorithm, which iteratively adds new models to the ensemble to improve the overall performance.

The key features of XGBoost include:

- __Regularization__
   
   XGBoost provides L1 and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
- __Tree pruning__
     
     XGBoost applies tree pruning to reduce the complexity of the model and improve generalization.
- __Parallel processing__
     
     XGBoost supports parallel processing and distributed computing, making it efficient for large datasets.
- __Handling missing values__
     
     XGBoost can handle missing values automatically by assigning them to the direction that best improves the loss function.
- __Cross-validation__
     
     XGBoost supports built-in cross-validation to help optimize hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.
